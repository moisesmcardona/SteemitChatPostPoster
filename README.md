# SteemitChatPostPoster
A tool that will post the links of your posts to Steem.Chat channels to promote them

To use it, just type your Steem.Chat username and password, Add the channels you wish to post your post links to, and then add the link to your post and press the "Send to Steem.Chat!" button.

You can also enter your Steem Username to get a list of your latest posts so you can easily share the post link to the chat channels!

If you want to send your post to different channels but need to remove and add more channels later, you can export your current channel list and import them later as needed. This is done via the "Channel List" menu item.

Enjoy! And remember to vote me as Witness in Steemit if you like this tool!

You can also vote me by pressing the "Vote Witness" menu item in the software!
